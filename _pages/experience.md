## Teaching and supervising 
* 2022, Teaching assistant; Spatial Ecology and Modelling for Master students, I designed and teached introducing R and R studio and associated commonly used packages, linear models, linear mixed-effect models. 
* 2018 Teaching assistant, community ecology field course for Master students, preparing measuring tools, setting up transect along an inundation gradient, illustrating the procedures in measuring plant traits and soil parameters. Island schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands.
* 2017 Teaching assistant, introducing 7-year larger and small herbivore exlusion experiments and their impact on vegetation for undergraduate students, floodplain within the Junner Koeland area, a 100-ha nature reserve along the river Overijsselse Vecht in the northeast of The Netherlands.
* 2016 Teaching assistant, field course for Master students, Hoge Veluwe National Park, The Netherlands.

* 2016 Co-supervision of Erik van Haeringen (Master); title “Long-term impacts of geese and hare grazing on vegetation dynamics along successional salt marsh gradient”
* Over the years, I worked with many junior researchers and helped some PhD, Master, and undergraduate students such as Jelle Janssen (Master; Wageningen University & Research) and Angelo Gioia (Master; Halle University) with their research, presentations, and scientific articles in a non-offical capacity.
