Hello everyone, my name is Qingqing Chen (陈青青). You could also call me QQ. I am a plant ecologist. I am from China originally, currently I work at German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) as a postdoc. My research focuses on plant diversity change (taxonomic, functional traits, and genotypes), its causes (e.g. herbivore loss, and nutrient enrichment) and consequences (e.g. ecosystem functions and their stability under increasing climate extremes) in herbaceous-dominated ecosystems.
